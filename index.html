    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Hi thanks for reading! I am an aspiring entry level web developer looking
      to start a career in web development and data analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having started out with 
      an educational background in Software Engineering 
      with Java I quickly fell in love with the simplicity of python and javascript and 
      decided to pursue a career in creating beautiful and functional web applications!
    </p>
      <p>If I had one super power it would be my ability to learn and pick up things quickly evidenced by how fast I finished my bootcamp and started doing projects.
      <p>I look forward to working with you to bring your website to the forefront of the world in the best and most beautiful way possible!</p>
    </p>
