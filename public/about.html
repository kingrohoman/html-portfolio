<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>To anyone who happens to stumble upon this and is reading it, from the bottom 
  of my heart, THANK YOU!</p>

<p>I have always been a smart cookie but never did I ever get into coding, but 
  COVID and a little tinkering around with most favorite machine and here I am 
  making my first portfolio website after 24 hrs of studying.
</p>

<p>When it comes to coding I know the sky is the limit and I see myself making 
  wonderful things. I will make sure I display I make good or bad so anyone 
  interested in learning how to code sees what it takes to get to where I know 
  I will eventually get.
</p>

<p>Extreme gratitude to anyone who is taking the time to read my thoughts and 
  hopefully follow along in my journey as I learn how to code and start creating 
  beautiful things.
</p>
<p>
  Sincerely, <br>
  Tariq
